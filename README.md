Now deployed, visit [Gomoku3](https://gomoku3.xyz)

The game logic is written in smart contract and running on blockchain, no need for a single game server anymore

which provide a game composability, like other people can build games (new frontend or add new rules) on top of it.

That’s why we call it “protocol”. 

Users can easily create AA wallets to save winnings or even easily trade thire accounts without private keys(based on ERC6551)

Gomoku was deployed on LootChain Testnet and OpBNB Testnet because of its fast block time and ultra low gas cost, which is a perfect match for a fully on-chain game.
